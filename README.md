# study_projects_py
My study projects written on Python.

Commit history:
- 09/10/2023 - uploaded a number guessing algorithm to try to solidify knowledge of basic Python syntax. Later on added a factual step count alongside optimal step count.
- 14/10/2023 - uploaded a password generator. It's configurable: you can specify how many passwords you need to generate, their length, their contents (digits, upper- and lowercase letters, special symbols, etc). TO-ADD: make sure that each type of symbols is used at least once, so that generated passwords are more secure.
